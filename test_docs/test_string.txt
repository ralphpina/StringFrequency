Write a function that takes two parameters: (1) a String representing a text document and (2) an integer providing the number of items to return. Implement the function such that it returns a list of Strings ordered by word frequency, the most frequently occurring word first. Use your best judgement to decide how words are separated. Your solution should run in O(n) time where n is the number of characters in the document. Implement this function as you would for a production/commercial system. You may use any standard data structures.
